To develop an online game (with superheroes) implement a software solution that allows:

1. The use of an external library that contains Disney characters.
- currently the game contains its own characters that are part of the ACME framework

2. Changing the characteristics of some superheroes during the game
- During the game superheroes can be equipped with new equipment
- The superhero's behavior can change dynamically depending on the interaction with the other characters in the game
