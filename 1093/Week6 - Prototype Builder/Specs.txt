1. All characters have a 3D graphic model
- instances of the same character can appear in the game
- creating the 3D model is an expensive process because it involves loading and generating the model
- an efficient solution must be found to create several instances of the same character

2. Instantiation of the superhero associated with the player
- there are many attributes to allow its customization
- name, is Positive, points Life, weapon Left Hand, weapon Right Hand, super Power, is Wounded Critical, super Super Power, etc.
- an efficient solution must be found that allows the creation of the superhero without giving values for all the attributes but also without allowing the programmers to omit some of them
