In order to create an online game (with superheroes), you need to create a software solution that will provide

1. Efficient management of the connection to the Database / logger
- the different modules must use or link an unique connection to the database
- programmers implementing those modules cannot build multiple objects associated with the database connection
- the client must use an unique object to take care of the connection to the database

2. The app will use different databases for development and production.
The connections to those db's must be unique without the overhead of creating multiple
singleton classes
