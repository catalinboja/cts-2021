To develop an online game (with superheroes) implement a software solution that allows:

1. The use of an external library that contains Disney characters.
- currently the game contains its own characters that are part of the ACME framework

2. Changing the characteristics of some superheroes during the game
- During the game superheroes can be equipped with new equipment
- The superhero's behavior can change dynamically depending on the interaction with the other characters in the game

3. In order to allow other companies or players to develop external solutions that connect to the game, a library (an API) must be developed.
- The API contains many classes with many details
- not all classes are documented
- The API should provide a simplified interface for a set of basic functions
