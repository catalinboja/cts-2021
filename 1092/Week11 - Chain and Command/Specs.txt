1. The game has an internal chat
- we want to filter comments / messages that are not appropriate
- messages destined for a certain player will be sent in private
- broadcast messages for everyone


2. The game client must perform tasks in the background without interfering with the development of the game (without blocking or slowing it down)
- customer data backup
- receive updates for the forum
- update 3D models in silent mode (during the game)
- a solution must be found through which these tasks can be executed without affecting the execution of the game
