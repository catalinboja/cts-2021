1. Create different weapon types in the game
- currently there are 3 types of weapons PISTOL, MACHINE_GUN and ROCKET
- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change

2. In order to allow other companies or players to develop external solutions that connect to the game, a library (an API) must be developed.
- The API contains many classes with many details
- not all classes are documented
- The API should provide a simplified interface for a set of basic functions
