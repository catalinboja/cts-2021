Code review

1. Code structure & naming conventions

- the package name is too generic; where is the module name ?
- the class name is saying nothing;
- the function name is too generic 
- the function arguments names are not OK
- t and s must have meaningful names


2. Implementation
- too many "magic numbers" (hard-coded values)
- is t limited to {1,2,3,4} or it can be bigger ?
- there are no validations for t, s, and perioada
